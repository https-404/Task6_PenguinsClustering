# Task6_PenguinsClustering

## Project Overview
Task6_PenguinsClustering is a data science project aimed at identifying and clustering different species of penguins in Antarctica based on their physical characteristics. The data used in this project were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **culmen_length_mm**: Culmen length (mm)
- **culmen_depth_mm**: Culmen depth (mm)
- **flipper_length_mm**: Flipper length (mm)
- **body_mass_g**: Body mass (g)
- **sex**: Penguin sex

The dataset does not include the species of penguins, but it is known that there are at least three species native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to apply data science techniques to cluster the penguin data into distinct groups, potentially corresponding to the different species.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset and handle any missing values.
2. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features for clustering.
3. **Data Standardization**: Standardize the features to ensure they are on the same scale.
4. **Optimal Number of Clusters**: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
5. **K-Means Clustering**: Perform k-means clustering with the optimal number of clusters.
6. **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters and analyze the cluster centers.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/https-404/Task6_PenguinsClustering.git
    cd Task6_PenguinsClustering
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Task6_PenguinsClustering.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The k-means clustering analysis identified three distinct groups in the penguin dataset. The cluster centers provide insights into the characteristics of each group, which likely correspond to the three species of penguins.
